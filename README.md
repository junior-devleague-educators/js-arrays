# js-arrays

## Getting Started

The following are exercises to practice creating arrays. Follow each set of directions and write your code in the JavaScript section of CodePen. Above each exercise please add a comment with the instructions. Example:

```
// Instructions go here
var myVariableName = ['items go in here'];

// Next set of instructions
var myOtherVariableName = ['items go in here']
```

### Exercises

Remember to console the variable after each exercise.

#### Creating Arrays

1.  Declare a variable named `studentNames` and assign it an array containing 5 names

2.  Declare a variable named `gradePointAvgs` and assign it an array containing 5 random GPAs

3.  Declare a variable named `hawaiiSchools` and assign it an array containing the names of 5 schools in Hawaii

4.  Declare a variable named `multipleDataTypes` and assign it an array containing 6 different

5.  Declare a variable named `dynamicDuos` and assign it an array containing 3 sub arrays, with each sub array containing 2 names.

#### Accessing Arrays

Use the following array for the next set of exercises. Remember to console log the variable after each exercise.

`var endangeredAnimals = ['Black Rhino', 'Sea Otter', 'Whooping Crane', 'Snow Leopard', 'Tiger', 'Gorilla', 'Orangutan'];`

1.  Get the length of the array and store it in a variable.

2.  Access the array and store each animal in it's own variable. You should have 7 total variables.

#### Stretch Goals

Using the variables you previously made to store individual animals, recreate the following sentences:

1.  "Black Rhinos have three toes."

2.  "Other than primates, Sea otters are one of few mammals known to use tools."

3.  "Sumatra is the last place on Earth that Orangutans, Rhinos, and Tigers live together."

4.  "As roaming herbivores, Gorillas play a vital role in seed dispersal."

5.  "In the summer, Snow Leopards may climb as high as 5000 meters above sea level!"
