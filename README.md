# js-arrays

## Getting Started

The following are exercises to practice creating arrays. Follow each set of directions and write your code in the JavaScript section of CodePen. Above each exercise please add a comment with the instructions. Example:

```
// Instructions go here
var myVariableName = ['items go in here'];

// Next set of instructions
var myOtherVariableName = ['items go in here']
```

### Exercises

Remember to console the variable after each exercise.

#### Creating Variables

1.  Declare a variable named `studentNames` and assign it an array containing 5 names

2.  Declare a variable named `gradePointAvgs` and assign it an array containing 5 random GPAs

3.  Declare a variable named `hawaiiSchools` and assign it an array containing the names of 5 schools in Hawaii

4.  Declare a variable named `multipleDataTypes` and assign it an array containing 6 different

5.  Declare a variable named `dynamicDuos` and assign it an array containing 3 sub arrays, with each sub array containing 2 names.

#### Accessing Variables

Use the following array for the next set of exercises. Remember to console log the variable after each exercise.

var endangeredAnimals = ['Black Rhino', 'Sea Otter', 'Whooping Crane', 'Snow Leopard', 'Tiger', 'Gorilla', 'Orangutan'];

1.  Get the length of the array and store it in a variable.

2.  Access the array and store each animal in it's own variable. You should have 7 total variables.
